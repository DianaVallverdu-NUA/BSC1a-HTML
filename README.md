# BSC1a-HTML

## What We Did
Today we coded our first website. We created a new HTML website and learned about [HTML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp).

## How to do it at home

### Preliminary Steps
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Open Visual Studio code and install the extension Live Server.
  - [Installing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
  - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
4. Create your own GitHub account. You can do so on this website. It is advised to create it with your student email account.

### Creating and Cloning a Repository
1. Login and [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). You should give it a significant name, for ex. **HTML Website**
2. Using GitHub Desktop, [clone your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=desktop) to your computer.
3. From GitHub Desktop, click the button "Open In Visual Studio Code"

### Creating your HTML file
1. From Visual Studio Code, create a new file and name it index.html
2. When you are editing that file, if you start typing 'html', a menu will appear with different options. Select the option 'html:5'. This will create the basis of your website.
3. Save this file
4. [Turn on the Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to preview your empty website
5. If you now edit the HTML file, you will see the updates by refreshing the page that has open. If you ever close it, you can simply restart the Live Server.

### The Task
1. Write or find a short story. 3 to 4 paragraphs of story should be enough. Make sure to give it a title!
2. Find one image that represents each of your paragraphs.
3. Using the provided guides in the following section, the code present in this repository, and the slides on the VLE, try and write this story on your webpage. You will want to use:
  - the `<p></p>` Tag for your paragraphs
  - the `<h1></h1>` Tag for your Heading
  - the `<img>` Tag for your images
  - the `<div></div>` Tag to group sections
You can have a go at styling your website, but we are not yet doing that until the next workshop on Tuesday 1st of October.
