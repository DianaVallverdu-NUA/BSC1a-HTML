            The big cat fell into the river and I saw a kitten riding a giant fish. The kitten and I locked eyes. It
            said
            "Meow"!

            The little kitty gets ready to punce onto the nearby pile of fish. The fish cried and asked for mercy. The
            cat
            however was ruthless and ate it!

            "You, feral Beast, how dare you gnaw on Graham?" I screamed, and chased the cat far away. Poor cat fell of
            the
            cliff and turned into a cat.rar
